# Peekaboo Release

Release `~/Projects/Peekaboo` as the npm package `@steipete/peekaboo` plus signed/notarized macOS app assets.

Use `$one-password`, `$browser-use`, `$npm`, `$autoreview`, and repo `AGENTS.md` rules. Load `$release-private` if it exists before resolving Peter-owned credential locators. Read `$npm` before any npm auth, token, or publish recovery work. Keep all `op` secret work inside one persistent tmux session. Never print `.p8`, npm tokens, passwords, or OTPs.

## Current Secrets

- Peter-owned credential item names, key ids, issuer ids, keychain paths, and npm token locators live in `$release-private`.
- Required ASC fields: `key_id`, `issuer_id`, `private_key_p8`.
- Stale/revoked key symptom: `xcrun notarytool submit` fails with `HTTP status code: 401. Unauthenticated`.
- All ASC fields must come from the same current item; do not mix profile values with 1Password refs.

Sparkle key:

- Repo `.mac-release.env` has the current fallback.
- Do not set `SPARKLE_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE` for normal releases.

Developer ID release keychain:

- Resolve the release keychain item/path from `$release-private`.
- If macOS shows `codesign wants to use the release keychain`, enter the keychain item password, not the Developer ID `.p12` password.
- The Developer ID certificate password is only for importing the `.p12` while creating the keychain.
- After setup/import, run `security unlock-keychain` and `security set-key-partition-list -S apple-tool:,apple:,codesign: -s -k "$KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD" "$KEYCHAIN_PATH"` so `codesign` can use the identity without GUI prompts.

npm publish token:

- Resolve token/TOTP locators from `$release-private`.
- Use `$npm` rules. Run inside the same tmux session, write only a temp npmrc, delete it immediately, and use the `npmjs` TOTP item for web auth if npm prompts.
- Do not create short-lived/granular bypass tokens for a normal Peekaboo publish. They add cleanup risk and did not help the 3.2.1 slow-upload/web-auth path.

## Notary Credential Check

Use the service account from `$release-private` first. Put the token in the tmux environment without printing it:

```bash
# Resolve SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN from $release-private first.
tmux -S "$SOCKET" set-environment -t "$SESSION" OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN "$SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN"
```

Create a temp env file with service-account refs from `$release-private`:

```text
APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_P8=<1Password ref from release-private>
APP_STORE_CONNECT_KEY_ID=<1Password ref from release-private>
APP_STORE_CONNECT_ISSUER_ID=<1Password ref from release-private>
```

Before a release, verify shape and Apple auth without printing values:

```bash
op run --env-file "$ENVFILE" -- bash -c '
  set -euo pipefail
  KEY_FILE="/tmp/AuthKey_${APP_STORE_CONNECT_KEY_ID}.p8"
  printf "%s\n" "$APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_P8" > "$KEY_FILE"
  chmod 600 "$KEY_FILE"
  xcrun notarytool history \
    --key "$KEY_FILE" \
    --key-id "$APP_STORE_CONNECT_KEY_ID" \
    --issuer "$APP_STORE_CONNECT_ISSUER_ID" \
    --output-format json >/dev/null
  rm -f "$KEY_FILE"
'
```

Peekaboo forces `notarytool submit --no-s3-acceleration`; the default S3 accelerated upload path can return a misleading `401` even when `history` auth succeeds.

If both `history` and non-S3 `submit` fail, suspect wrong access level or stale key. Browser route:

1. Use `$browser-use` real Chrome profile.
2. Open `https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/access/integrations/api`.
3. Generate Team Key named `Peekaboo Release <version>` with `Admin` access.
4. Download `.p8` once from the key row.
5. Store immediately into the private credential map; verify `notarytool history`; delete `~/Downloads/AuthKey_<key_id>.p8`.
6. Revoke the older Peekaboo release key after the new key validates.

## Release Flow

1. Start on clean `main`; pull ff-only if needed.
2. Set version in:
   - `package.json`
   - `version.json`
   - `Apps/CLI/Sources/Resources/version.json`
   - README npm badge
   - `Core/PeekabooCore/Sources/PeekabooAgentRuntime/MCP/PeekabooMCPVersion.swift`
   - Xcode marketing versions under `Apps/*`
3. Date `CHANGELOG.md` and `Apps/CLI/CHANGELOG.md` for the release.
4. Run focused proof or release script preflight. Release gates must be warning-free.
5. Use `$autoreview` before commit unless the change is trivial/docs-only.
6. Commit release prep with `committer`.
7. Push `main`.
8. Run:

```bash
op run --env-file "$ENVFILE" -- \
  bash -lc 'printf "y\n" | ./scripts/release-binaries.sh --create-github-release --publish-npm'
```

The script builds universal CLI, npm package, signed/notarized app zip, appcast, checksums, draft GitHub release, and npm publish.

Notarized releases must sign with `Developer ID Application: Peter Steinberger (Y5PE65HELJ)`, not `Apple Development`. If your shell has `SIGN_IDENTITY` exported for CLI builds, override it for the release command.

If npm upload is slow and TOTP expires, use the stored npm token through a temp npmrc and complete npm web auth immediately when prompted with the configured TOTP. Do not create granular bypass tokens for this; if one was created by mistake, delete it before closeout.

## Verify

Required before closeout:

```bash
npm view @steipete/peekaboo@<version> version dist-tags dist.tarball dist.integrity time --json
gh release view v<version> --repo openclaw/Peekaboo --json tagName,isDraft,isPrerelease,url,assets,body
xmllint --noout appcast.xml
git status --short --branch
```

Confirm:

- npm version exists and `latest` points to it.
- GitHub release/tag/assets exist; release body is from changelog.
- app zip asset exists and appcast points at `v<version>`.
- `appcast.xml` changes are committed and pushed.
- Publish draft release if the script leaves it draft.

## Closeout

1. Add next patch `Unreleased` section to root and CLI changelogs.
2. Commit with `committer "docs(changelog): open <next-version>" CHANGELOG.md Apps/CLI/CHANGELOG.md`.
3. Push.
4. Watch release/homebrew/CI workflows if triggered.
5. `git checkout main && git pull --ff-only && git status --short --branch`.
6. Clear tmux `OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN`, remove temp env/key files, and final with what landed.
